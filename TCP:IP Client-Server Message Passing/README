INSTRUCTIONS:

1) unzip ELFbinary_recon.zip into preferred directory
2) make sure elf binary is in that same directory for verification

3) start server executable to wait for a connection 
4) start client executable with appropriate IP to connect to the server  
5) execute available commands
	'verify' - verify an elf binary
Prompt user for an elf binary to analyze. Sends to server if specified.

	'request' - get information on a binary on the server

Admin is able to request all information on stored binaries.
 
	'admin' - enter special administration mode (password = "#Harambe")
*****************************************NOTE*************************************
